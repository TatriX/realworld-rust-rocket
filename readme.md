[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/anishkny/realworld-rust-rocket.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/anishkny/realworld-rust-rocket)

> ###  Rust / Rocket codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) spec and API.

### [Demo](http://demo.realworld.io/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)

This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with [Rocket](http://rocket.rs/) including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the [Rocket](http://rocket.rs/) community styleguides & best practices.

For more information on how to this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.
